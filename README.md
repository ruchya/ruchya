I am Ruchya Sudke. I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Intelligent Agent Lab at University of Central Florida under the guidance of Prof. Gita Sukthankar. Currently we are working on understanding the user behaviour will playing Minecraft game.
I am a Machine Learning enthusiastic. I like the fact that we can gain a lot of knowledge and train a machine to provide the results we want. I have been developing projects on various subjects I studied during my Masters. Previously I worked as a Java Developer for 2 years.
I love exploring different cuisines and places.
